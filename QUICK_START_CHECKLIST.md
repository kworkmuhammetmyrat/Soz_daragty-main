curl http://localhost:3001/health
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "websocket_clients": 2,
  "redis_status": "ready"
}
```

### WebSocket Check (Browser Console)
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for messages

**Expected:**
- [ ] "WebSocket connected"
- [ ] No error messages

---

## Build Verification

```bash
npm run build
```

**Expected Output:**
- [ ] Build completes without errors
- [ ] No TypeScript errors
- [ ] Bundle size: ~720KB
- [ ] Warnings about chunk size (normal, can be ignored)

---

## Troubleshooting

### ❌ Backend Won't Start

**Error:** `Redis connection failed`

**Fix:**
```bash
# Check if Redis is running
docker ps | grep redis

# If not running, start it
docker start local-redis

# If doesn't exist, create it
docker run --name local-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis:latest
```

---

### ❌ WebSocket Not Connecting

**Error:** Browser console shows "WebSocket error"

**Fix:**
1. Check backend is running: `cd backend && npm start`
2. Check port 8080 is free: `lsof -i :8080` (macOS/Linux)
3. Restart backend and refresh browser

---

### ❌ Sounds Not Playing

**Error:** No audio

**Fix:**
1. Check browser audio permissions
2. Unmute browser tab
3. Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
4. Click anywhere on page to unlock audio (mobile)

---

### ❌ Timer Shows Wrong Duration

**Error:** Timer starts at 16 instead of 30

**Fix:**
1. Clear browser cache and reload
2. Check if `useCountdown.ts` was updated correctly
3. Rebuild: `npm run build`

---

### ❌ No Realtime Updates

**Error:** Changes in Admin don't appear in Contestant

**Fix:**
1. Check backend terminal shows "WebSocket client connected"
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Verify Redis is running: `docker ps | grep redis`
4. Restart backend and refresh both tabs

---

## Success Criteria

**All fixes verified if:**
- [ ] All 10 feature tests pass
- [ ] Performance checks normal
- [ ] Build succeeds without errors
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] Backend terminal shows normal activity
- [ ] Realtime sync works (<100ms latency)

---

## Next Steps

Once all checkboxes are complete:

1. **Test with real users** - Have someone play the actual game
2. **Monitor backend logs** - Watch for any unexpected errors
3. **Test on mobile** - Verify responsive design and touch controls
4. **Stress test** - Open 5+ tabs and verify sync still works
5. **Long-running test** - Leave game open for 1 hour, verify no memory leaks
